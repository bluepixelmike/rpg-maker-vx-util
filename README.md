# RPG Maker VX Utilities

Contains utilities and libraries for accessing and modifying RPG Maker VX (Ace) projects.
This gem effectively lets developers write RPG Maker games in their own environments.
It provides functionality for importing and exporting data from RPG Maker VX projects.
All credit and ownership for the original code goes to Enterbrain - the creators of RPG Maker.

**NOTE:**
This gem is not a substitute for RPG Maker VX!
The original program is still needed to generate the binary (.exe and .dll) files.
These files are proprietary of Enterbrain.
